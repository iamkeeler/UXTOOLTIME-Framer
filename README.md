# Description
Hello There! We got tired of writing the same base Android and iOS system level things in Framer so we made a snippet library. Usually we prefer to work mainly in the code side and have short cuts for the things we always use helped speed our flow up. Now we just wanted to share with you all.

<br>

# Examples
- [Need to Replace](URL GOES HERE)

<br>

# How to use it?
1. Download the snippets.
2. Copy the Snippets over to your Framer Snippets Folder (Easist way to get here is to open Framer. Open the snippets menu and click "Show Snippets Folder...")
3. Use the Snippets.
4. Make magic happen!

<br>

# Who We Are
1. Ryan Huettl - This one is mainly this guy
2. Monika Perkerwicz
3. Chris Ernt
4. Gary Keeler
